    <h2><em>Story</em></h2>
    <p>In the world of Robloxia, Kir are marvelous things.
        <br>
        They may seem like just another collectible, but they are far more important.
        <br>
        A Kir is made out of 2 things - an Inner Kir, and an Outer Kir. The Outer Kir keeps the Inner Kir stay in the air, while the Inner Kir, shaped like a heart, has a very special ability. It is to store love and compassion.
        <br>
        All Kir has a very special purpose - spreading comforting love all around. Without Kir, the world would be without joy.
        <br>
        One day, all Kir got scattered all over Robloxia!
        <br>
        Now it must be you who stops Robloxia from feeling sad and unhappy by collecting all of the Kir!.
